## Machine Learing Algorithmen

* computional methods that allow computers to leran from and make decisisons or predictions based on the data
* they do this by identifying patterns and relationships
* during a process called "training"
* an algorithm will adjust its parameters in order to minimize errors
* once the training is finished the algorithm can made predictions on data he has never seen before
* this is the core of artifical intelligence
* key algorithms
  * linear regression
  * decision trees
  * random forests
  * k-means
  * k-nearest neighbors
  * support vector machines (SVMS)
* python libraries
  * scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
  * numpy (https://numpy.org/)
  * pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/)
  * matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)
  * seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
  * squid-AI (https://squid.cloud/)
 
## Neural Networks

* are specific type of machine learning algorithm whose architecture is inspired by the function of the human brain
* can automatically extract and learn more complex features of raw data
* components of neural networks
  * layers (input, hidden, output)
  * neurons and activation functions
  * backpropagation (helps the robot learn from its mistakes by fixing them)
  * gradient descent (guides the robot to the right answer by taking small, careful steps)
* modules
  * pytorch (https://pytorch.org/)
  * tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/)
  * keras (https://keras.io/)
* neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT) - (https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/neat_overview.html)

## Computer Vision

* refers to doing image and video analysis and typically things like object detection and tracking, facial recognition, image segmentation, etc
* opencv python
* convolutional neural networks (we take an image an analyse it using machine learning algorithm)
* modules
  * opencv (https://opencv.org/)
  * skikit-image (https://scikit-image.org/)
  * pillow (https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ ; https://python-pillow.org/)
 
## LLMs

* one of the most misunderstood forms of AI in terms of what they actually do and how you can use them
* are designed to understand and generate human language in a broad sense
* they are trained on tons of data like
  * books
  * movies
  * articles
  * internet
  * ...
* they can answer questions
* they can generate essays
* they can write code
* fine-tuning is the process of passing specific data related to exactly what you want this llm to do
  * medical diagnosis
  * ...
* key models
  * GPT (generative pre-trained transformers)
    * generates text, processes text unidirectionally (left and right) and is great for creating new content
  * BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers)
    * understands text, processes text bidirectionally (left to right and right to left), and is great for understanding and interpreting existing content.
* python modules
  * huggingface (https://huggingface.co/)

## RAG (Retrieval augmented generation)
