## Machine Learing Algorithmen

* computional methods that allow computers to leran from and make decisisons or predictions based on the data
* they do this by identifying patterns and relationships
* during a process called "training"
* an algorithm will adjust its parameters in order to minimize errors
* once the training is finished the algorithm can made predictions on data he has never seen before
* this is the core of artifical intelligence
* key algorithms
  * linear regression
  * decision trees
  * random forests
  * k-means
  * k-nearest neighbors
  * support vector machines (SVMS)
* python libraries
  * scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
  * numpy (https://numpy.org/)
  * pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/)
  * matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)
  * seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
  * squid-AI (https://squid.cloud/)
